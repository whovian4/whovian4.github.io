    <h3>(a) Sequence Converging to Supremum (15/15 Marks)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stating Supremum Exists (0/2):</strong> You needed to write that since S is bounded above, by the Continuum Property, a least upper bound (supremum) of S exists, and only then, could you label sup(S) as B. Furthermore, the existence of an infinite sequence in S that is bounded above is something you must prove and you cannot state that such an infinite sequence exists without proving it. I have not deducted marks for this.</li>
        <li><strong>Using Supremum Definition (5/5):</strong> You correctly used the property that "B - ε is not the upper bound" to justify the existence of an element, x_N ∈ S in the desired interval.</li>
        <li><strong>Sequence Construction (4/4):</strong> The construction of the sequence {x_n}_{n∈N} is somewhat flawed. You state "Thus, ∃N, s.t. B - ϵ < x_n ∀n≥N". This implicitly assumes that the N-tail of the constructed sequence is non-decreasing, which, for an appropriately chosen finite set and ϵ may be able to extract only a constant sequence, given by (x_N, x_N, x_N, ...). I have not deducted any marks for this as the wording of the question did not state to extract a non-constant sequence from S.</li>
        <li><strong>Establishing Inequality (2/2):</strong> The inequality B - ϵ < x_n ≤ B is correctly stated for the constant sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Concluding Convergence (2/2):</strong> You provided a valid and clear proof of convergence of the constant sequence using an epsilon-based argument, showing that |B - x_n| < ϵ.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(b) Sequence Diverging to +∞ (15/15 Marks)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stating Unbounded Property (3/3):</strong> Here again, you have stated the result that needs to be proven! That, since S is unbounded, one can find a sequence {x_n} ⊂ S that is also unbounded. For full rigor, you should have stated the formal definition of an unbounded set: ∀H > 0 ∃x ∈ S such that x > H.</li>
        <li><strong>Sequence Construction (6/6):</strong> Your construction of a sequence where x_n > n is correct.</li>
        <li><strong>Definition of Divergence (2/2):</strong> The formal definition of divergence was stated correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Completion of Proof (4/4):</strong> Your argument showing that for any real H, you can find N such that for all n > N, x_n > n > N > H, is a correct and complete proof of divergence. This correctly uses the logic of the Archimedean property.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> Your presentation could be improved. Check the official marking scheme for a clearer presentation.</p>

    <h3>(c) Boundedness of a Continuous Function (35/35 Marks)</h3>
    <p>This was a perfect and elegantly argued proof by contradiction. Kudos!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Setup (6/6):</strong> You correctly set up the proof by assuming that f is not bounded on C.</li>
        <li><strong>From Unbounded Set to Unbounded Sequence (6/6):</strong> You cleverly and correctly used the result from part (b) to state that an unbounded set f(C) must contain a sequence, {y_n}_{n∈N} that diverges to +∞. Furthermore, you related the unbounded image sequence to a definite sequence of preimages, {x_n}_{n∈N} ⊂ C such that f(x_n) = y_n.</li>
        <li><strong>Using Compactness of C (10/10):</strong> You correctly invoked the compactness of C and the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem to find a convergent subsequence {x_{n_k}}_{k∈N} → x* ∈ C.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploiting continuity (6/6):</strong> You correctly used the continuity of f to state that {f(x_{n_k})}_{k∈N} must converge to the finite real number f(x*).</li>
        <li><strong>Deriving Contradiction (5/5):</strong> You gave an exceptionally clear explanation of the contradiction: a sequence diverging to +∞ must have all its subsequences also diverge, but you showed this subsequence converges to a finite real number.</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion (2/2):</strong> The final conclusion is correctly stated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>(d) Extreme Value Theorem (35/35 Marks)</h3>
    <p>Another flawless proof that correctly follows the logic of Approach 1. Brilliant!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Existence of supremum of f(C) (8/8):</strong> You correctly stated that f is bounded (from part c) and has a supremum by the Continuum Property.</li>
        <li><strong>Sequence of images in f(C) (8/8):</strong> You correctly used the result from part (a) to construct a sequence of function values, {y_n}_{n∈N} ⊂ f(C), that converges to the supremum.</li>
        <li><strong>Sequence of pre-images (4/4):</strong> You correctly defined the pre-image sequence {x_n}_{n∈N} from y_n = f(x_n).</li>
        <li><strong>Exploiting compactness of C (5/5):</strong> You correctly used the compactness of C and BWT to find a convergent subsequence {x_{n_k}}_{k∈N} → x* ∈ C.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploiting continuity of f (4/4):</strong> You correctly used continuity to show that {{f(x_{n_k})}_{k∈N} → f(x*)}.</li>
        <li><strong>Connecting Limits (4/4):</strong> You correctly argued that by the uniqueness of limits, the limit of the subsequence must be the same as the limit of the original sequence, thus f(x*) = y_s.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Conclusion (2/2):</strong> The final statement covering both the maximum and minimum is correct.</li>
    </ul>
